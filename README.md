# ðŸ“¦ 11ty-snowpack-starter by lean-coders

[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), powered by [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/).
Get blazing fast updates if only altering/adding content thx to eleventy. Get fast rebuilds in dev-mode thx to snowpack and bundle only for production.

In addition the following libraries / tools are installed and configured:

- [postcss](https://postcss.com): []()optimize imports, setup [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com), transpile css for older browsers with [postcss-preset-env]() and minify via [cssnano]() in production
- [rollup](https://rollup.com): bundle for production via rollup for optimal performance, uses [babel](https://babel.com) to transpile code for old browsers with the help of preset-env (only in production) and [terser](http://terser.com) to minify
- [typescript](https://typescriptlang.com): optionally static type-checks
- [prettier](https://prettier.io): never manually format your code again
- [eslint](https://eslint.io): lint your code to avoid common mistakes (preconfigured for typescript)
